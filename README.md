Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort, but I can do it!

What you like most about version control:
- It records everything and it compares the differences between versions clearly!

What you find most challenging/confusing/frustrating about version control:
- The conflicts and rebase because I am always afraid of destoying (or accidentally delete) other teammates' work when trying to slove the conflicts.
